# Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of deep-learning projects! This repository showcases a variety of projects focused on different aspects of deep learning. Each project has a unique objective and dataset, offering a glimpse into the diverse applications of deep learning techniques.

## Project 1: Image Classifier

### Objective
The objective of this project is to build an image classifier capable of identifying four different categories of images. The dataset comprises various training and test samples across these four categories. Each category's data consists of images that have been transformed through flips, rotations, or other alterations.

### Tools/Models Used
- Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
- Image Augmentation
- TensorFlow / PyTorch

## Project 2: Recurrent Neural Network & Classification

### Objective
This project focuses on detecting security breaches by predicting suspicious access using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. It utilizes the provided Logfile data for training and testing.

### Tools/Models Used
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Sequence-to-Sequence Learning
- Python


## Project 3: Time Series with LSTMs

### Objective
In this project, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are employed to tackle time series data. The objective varies based on the specific dataset and use case, highlighting the versatility of LSTMs in modeling sequential data.

### Tools/Models Used
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
- Time Series Analysis
- Pandas / NumPy

## Project 4: Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs)

### Objective
This project explores Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) for image compression. VAEs are used to efficiently encode and decode images while preserving their essential features. The focus is on image compression with minimal loss of quality.

### Technologies Used
- Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs)
- Image Compression
- Keras / TensorFlow
